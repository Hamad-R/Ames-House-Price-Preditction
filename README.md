# Ames-House-Price-Preditction
Prediction of price Located in AMES area in United States with R

We have a database of ames homes. To begin, we'll fix any issues with the variable's data quality, such as removing any outliers, and then add some additional variables, such as the total number of bathrooms, which is the sum of the variables "Full bath, half bath, basement full bath, and basement half bath." Besides this one, we included four others: "Garage, Bsmt, Pool, total_sf." After that, we removed the corresponding columns from the table.
The focus of this logbook is a regression model, which will be used to estimate the sales price utilizing numerous variables from the ames data set. To begin, though, we'll conduct a principal component analysis to choose which variables to utilize. Then we'll conduct correlation and hypothesis tests to determine how well the variables that we'll acquire from the principal component analysis correlate with one another. Regarding our models we are going to start with a linear model and then move towards more complex multi linear regression models with different variables. We are also going to do a weighted multi linear regression model at the end. Regarding the split of the model, we have done a stratified random split in the ration of 80:20 keeping sales price column as our target variable so that the training and the test data have all kinds of values, and one data does not end up with higher or lower values.
